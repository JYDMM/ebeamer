## Getting Started
- Just want to try out the VST or the app? Go the the [release](https://github.com/listensmart/ebeamer/releases) page.
- A demo REAPER project is available [here](docs/eBeamerDemo.rpp).
- If you're not familiar with JUCE, [this](https://juce.com/learn) is a good place to start.
- If you're developing on Windows, download and extract the [ASIO ASK](https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html) in the *ASIO/* folder.
- Don't have the eSticks yet? Start developing with the [eStick simulator](https://github.com/luca-bondi/estick-simulator).
